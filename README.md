# MicrosoftMalwareClassification
Detect the malware class of the given software files based on the code.


> First separated byte and asm files and performed analysis separately.

<h4><b> Byte (unigrams+bigrams) files</b></h4>

> For each file computed both unigrams(256) and bigrams(65536+1) and stored in a csv and sparse matrix format. It resulted in 65793 features.

> Using truncated svd to reduce dimensionality of data, transformed the features into planes where ~94% of variance is preserved using 1500 components.

> Then performed classification using various models which resulted in the least log-loss of 0.870 uing byte features.

<h4><b> ASM(unigrams) files + pixels(ams, byte) files</b></h4>

> Computed unigrams of the top 50 most important words in all files.
 
> Then converted both asm and byte files into pixels and took the first 800 pixels as features.

> Performed classification by combining both unigrams and pixel features and obtained a least log-loss of <b>0.023</b>

<h4><b> ASM+Byte files(unigrams+bigrams+pixel intensities)</b></h4>

> Combined all the features i.e. unigrams, bigrams, pixel intensities.

> Performed classification using
><ol>
<li>Random forest: log-loss:- 0.029</li>
<li>Xgboost : log-loss:- 0.0183</li>
<li>Xgboost with important features from random forest: log-loss:- 0.0176
</ol>

> While performing classification task all the features are normalized where in an otherwise case log-loss found to be grown.

> The asm files unigram features along with pixel intensities found to be useful compared to the unigram and bigram features of bytefiles.
